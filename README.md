# Few-Shot-Learning
Few Shot Learning is the next generation class of algorithms being researched currently for object categorization tasks in Computer vision with unseen data and without pre-training.

Some popular algorithms:

* 'Matching networks for one shot learning'
* 'Learning to compare: Relation network for few-shot learning'
* **Prototypical Networks algorithm for few shot learning**

This repo demonstrates experiments conducted with the prototypical networks algorithm as published in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.05175). Two key changes improves the accuracy (88%) of a 5-way 5-shot classification task, the details of which are provided in the report.
